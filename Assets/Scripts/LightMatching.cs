/*       *************************** HOW TO USE **********************************
 
    Just Attach to your AR camera or Create an empty GameObject in your scene and attach this script
    Most likely you'll have at least one light in your sceen. add your light to the public Light To Effect var in the editor.
    You'll need to modify the code if you have more than one light you'd like to affect. 
 
    To see get dev/debugging readouts create a screen overlay canvas with a couple of text objects. add them to the lightoutput vars in the editor
     
    Can varify that a this light estimation script works in iphone7, Samsung S6, and pixel
    Should also work in the Unity editor as well.
 
         ***************************   ENJOY!   **********************************
